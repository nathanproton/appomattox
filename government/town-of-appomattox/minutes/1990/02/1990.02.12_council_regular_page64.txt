Council Minutes - February 12, 1990

Bernard Proctor, reported on the National Park Service. After
the study done by the National Park Service personnel, it is

not feasible for the lines to be constructed as Council
previously requested. We will have to go along Route 24 and the
Town will not provide any maintenance on the National Park
Service property due to the many restraints.

On a motion by Mr. Conner, seconded by Mr. Bass, Council resolved
to appoint S. E. Carter, to the Appomattox County Community
Center Board of Directors, and all those present voting aye.
