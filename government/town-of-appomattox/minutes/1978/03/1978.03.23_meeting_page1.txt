Dear Mr. Briston:

Drs. Mathews, Fratrick & Powell have recently completed the interior of the basement of their office building for rental purposes. It is designed for office rental such as Insurance, Attorney, Tax Experts and other small offices to house Public Servants. This portion of the basement has been in existence now for 8 years. We have inquired several neighbors and they do not object to this type use of the basement of our building.

We respectfully request your consideration in whatever authorization may be required.

Sincerely,

John A. Mathews, M.D.
