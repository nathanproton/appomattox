Mr. Britton reported that we are applying for $600,000.00 of Single Purpose funds for Community Development.

These funds would be used to construct and rehabilitate water lines and restore and rehabilitate some sewer lines. More pre-applications will be submitted to HUD than can be funded. The Town will first have to submit a pre-application and if accepted for funding, a full application will have to be submitted to HUD.
