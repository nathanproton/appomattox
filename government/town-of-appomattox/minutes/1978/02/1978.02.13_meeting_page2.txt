WHEREAS, the Town of Appomattox is serviced by the Appomattox Volunteer Rescue Squad, and considers the job well done; and

WHEREAS, the Town Council feels that the adoption of the law would do away with the Rescue Squad and the Town could not afford to duplicate this service at this time; and

WHEREAS, many, many lives have been saved in the Town of Appomattox by the Volunteer Rescue Squad;

THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Town of Appomattox Town Council is opposed to the adoption of the proposed Rules and Regulations Governing Ambulance Services, drafted by the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services, State Health Department.

There being no further business to come before Council, the meeting was adjourned.
