Gentlemen:

It is the desire of Mr. John R. Lawson Jr., Mr. Dan Berncall and me, to construct a two level office building on a lot fronting on the southwestern side of Court Street in the Town of Appomattox. This particular lot is the second lot north of the offices of Dr. Patrick, Dr. Matthews and Dr. Powell, on which there is presently a two story frame dwelling. Mr. John R. Lawson Jr. owns this lot.

We respectfully request your authorization to construct a two level office on this property, with a type of Colonial architecture, containing approximately 2000 square feet on each level. The upper level would be used by Falling River Realty Company Inc. and Thomas W. Lawson, Attorney at Law. The lower level would possibly be leased to such tenants as insurance offices, tax experts, and other small offices that would serve the public. None of the additional space would be leased for any type of retail or wholesale business.

Your time and consideration in this matter are greatly appreciated.

Very truly yours

[signed]

Thomas W. Lawson
