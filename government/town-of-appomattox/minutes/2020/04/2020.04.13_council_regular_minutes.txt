Regular Council Meeting
April 13, 2020

WHEREAS, there are actions which must be taken by the Town of Appomattox in the

next several months which will, by law, require the action of the Town Council, and currently it
is unsafe for physical meetings to occur in order to conduct normal, required business operations;
and,

WHEREAS, Section 15.2-1413 of the Code of Virginia (1950) as amended, provides that

“notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, general or special, any locality, may, by
ordinance, provide a method to assure continuity in its government, in the event of an enemy
attack or other disaster.  Such ordinance shall be limited in its effect to a period not exceeding
six months after any such enemy attack or disaster and shall provide for a method for the
resumption of normal governmental authority by the end of the six-month period (emphasis
added)”; and,

WHEREAS, Section 2.2-3708.2 of the Code of Virginia provides for electronic meetings
in the event of an emergency but does not currently extend the authority for electronic meetings
to issues not involving the emergency.  Given the likely duration of this disaster, meetings of the
Town Council and other Authorities, Boards, and Commissions must be held in the interim for
the continuity and continuing operation of the functions of the Town’s government, including but
not limited to the adoption of the Town’s budget; and,

WHEREAS, give the severe limitations on the gathering of people during the COVID-19

pandemic, which gathering is necessary and required for many essential tasks of the Town
government, as well as to fulfill the necessary obligations of the Town to its residents and
businesses, the Town Council finds it necessary to provide, by ordinance, a method of
transacting necessary public business during the disaster without the physical attendance or
gathering of people during the duration of the COVID-19 disaster.

Virginia; the following emergency measures are ADOPTED by the Appomattox Town Council:

order to conduct business.  Meetings shall be conducted in an electronic format which allows and
enables citizens to both observe and participate in said meetings electronically.  Due to the
closure of public buildings, meeting notices and agendas shall be posted on the Town’s website

Instructions regarding how citizens may observe and participate in meetings shall be maintained
