A meeting of the Water and Sewage Committee was held in the Town Office on October 28, 1969, at 7:30. Chairman R. T. Bass and Member R. Webb were present. Mayor H. R. Pack was also present.

A letter from J. F. Sears and Co., Inc., was read requesting that they be permitted to use transite water pipe instead of lined cast iron pipe for a portion of the distance in a proposed extension of the Town water line to serve a subdivision off of Highway 511.

Booth reported that he had called Mr. Elliott, Consulting Engineer, and that he recommended that the Town require the use of lined cast iron pipes. He said that the cast iron pipe would give very little trouble, and that the cost of laying the transite pipe and the subsequent painting was as high as the cost of the lined east iron pipe which required no painting, and being easier.

The Committee decided to require the use of the lined cast iron pipe.
