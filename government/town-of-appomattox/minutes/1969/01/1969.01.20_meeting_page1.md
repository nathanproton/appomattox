content: The regular meeting of the Appomattox Town Council was held in the Council Room on January 20, 1969, at 7:30 P.M. with Mayor H. B. Pack presiding.

Members present were Mrs. Calvin Robinson, R. L. Bass, Burke Guth, Ivey Holland, R. C. Hubbard, and M. L. Webb.

The meeting was opened with a prayer.

Mr. G. E. Harvey, representing Robinson Funeral Home, Inc., appeared before the Council and explained that the firm could no longer legally furnish ambulance service to the public. He said that new State Laws requiring expensive equipment and trained personnel made the cost prohibitive. He requested that the Council and the County Board of Supervisors get together and see if some arrangements could be made to take care of the need.

The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.

Hubbard reported that the fence has been built at the Sanitary Fill.

Bass moved and Hubbard seconded that "Be it resolved that the Town Council commends Officer Edwin E. Wallace for his alertness in discovering and awasting a man who was in the process of robbing a business in the early hours of the morning of November 30, 1968."

The motion was unanimously carried. Officer Wallace is to be notified of this.

The meeting adjourned.
