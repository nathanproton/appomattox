A special call of Council was held on Monday, April 28, 1980, at 5:00 P.M. with Mayor Spiggle presiding.

Members present were R. C. Hubbard, S. E. Carter, T. W. Lawson, R. L. Bass, and T. E. Conner. Absent- M. E. Gordon.

Also present was W. R. Britton, Jr., Town Manager.

The Mayor called the meeting to order and read the "Call" to Council. See copy of attached call.

The only item for discussion is the connection of Virten, LTD., to the Town's water and sewerage systems.

Mayor Spiggle brought Council up-to-date on the latest developments. He stated that we had been in contact with Mr. Ed Ragland, State Director, of the Farmers Home Administration. He wants to know if water and sewer service is available to Virten, LTD.

After a lengthy discussion, Mr. Conner made the motion, seconded by Mr. Carter, to rescind the previous motion as made in the meeting of October 15, 1979, and any other, and all motions concerning the connection to the Town's sewer system for Virten, LTD.

Conner-aye Carter-aye Hubbard-aye Lawson-aye Bass-aye Motion carried unanimously.

Mr. Conner made the motion, seconded by Mr. Carter, to deny the connection to the Town of Appomattox's sewer system, of Virten LTD. or Greater Boston Development as it is known now and so authorize Mr. Britton to notify Greater Boston and the other concerned parties of Council's action.

Conner-aye Carter-aye Bass-aye Lawson-aye Hubbard-aye Motion carried unanimously.

Council took this action due to the fact that we are in the process of rejecting the Sewerage Facility grant, the possibility of not building the New Facility, and with this in mind, the Town will have to look towards the priorities of the in-Town connections.

The meeting adjourned.
