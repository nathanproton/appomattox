A Special Call of Council was held on Monday, May 19, 1980 at 7:30 P.M. with Mayor Spiggle presiding.

Those present were: R. C. Hubbard, R. L. Bass, S. E. Carter, M. E. Gordon, and T. E. Conner. Absent: I. W. Lawson.

Also present were Dr. James C. May & Bernie Procter, Bill Sherrod, B.H. Mullins, Clerk, and W. R. Britton, Jr., Town Manager.

Mayor Spiggle opened the meeting.

Mr. Britton reported to Council on his meeting with the State Water Control Board in Richmond. The outcome of this meeting was that the Town would have three options which are:

1. Reduce Service Areaâ€”Refurbish the existing Plant and run a line to Falling River.
2. Reduce Service Area - Use the existing Plant as a "Pre-Treatment" System and go with Overland Flow.
3. Move the actual Treatment further down the line and pump the Sewerage down to it.

If the Town agrees to go with any of these options, then we have to go with an "Addendum" process to the Facilities Plan. The deadline in order to be funded would be July 1, 1980.

It was the general consensus of Town Council that we get some approximate cost estimates from our Engineers on these three options as stated above.

The meeting adjourned at 9:40 P.M.
