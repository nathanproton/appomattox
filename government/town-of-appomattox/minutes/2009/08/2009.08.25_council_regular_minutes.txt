Verbatim minutes from the Workshop Meeting on Tuesday, August 25, 2009 –
7:00 pm

Bart Van Nieuwenhuise:
“Attended a meeting with Anderson & Associates on the current groundwater

study.  We are in the process and have sent out numerous letters for permission

from property owners to look at for four potential sites that have been identified.

The existing data and aerial analysis of fractures and fault lines.  The meeting was

very productive.  Their geologist subcontractor was very optimistic about finding

water at these four sites in the depth of 600-800 feet.  We will proceed on those

four sites as far as getting permission from the property owners.  We had a list of

85 property owners we have reduced it to working with 8 for those four sites.”
