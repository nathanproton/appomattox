content: RESOLUTION OF THE APPOMATTOX TOWN COUNCIL OPPOSING PROPOSALS BY THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET AND THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TO CLOSE THE WEATHER STATION AT LYNCHBURG AIRPORT.

WHEREAS, the topography and other factors which affect weather are highly complex and variable in the region served by the Lynchburg weather station; and

WHEREAS, trained weather personnel with local knowledge are needed within the region to provide competent weather information and consultation; and

WHEREAS, there are substantial weather differences between Central Virginia and the Roanoke Valley, and between Central Virginia and Richmond; and

WHEREAS, both the Office of Management and Budget and the National Weather Service have proposed closing the Lynchburg weather station; and

WHEREAS, such closing would force residents and other users of local weather information to depend on such information generated at stations in the Roanoke Valley and/or Richmond; and

WHEREAS, there is a need for local weather information for agriculture, schools, aviation, businesses, government services, planning, and other purposes; and

WHEREAS, the service provided by the Lynchburg Weather Station benefits the health, safety, and welfare of all persons in Appomattox, Virginia, and not just a few persons or special interests, and is a service most appropriately provided by the federal government;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Town Council of Appomattox, in regular session assembled, hereby opposes any proposal which would result in the termination of services provided by the Lynchburg weather station.

Upon motion by Councilman Hubbard, duly seconded by Councilman Carter, adopted this 21st day of February 1979, with 4 of the 6 members of the Appomattox Town Council in attendance.
