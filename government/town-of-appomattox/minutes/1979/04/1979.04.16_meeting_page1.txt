Mr. Lawson made the motion seconded by Mr. Conner, to pay the Town's 25% of the S.S.ES. Project out of the $10,000.00 savings certificate set aside for the Water Fund and the balance to be applied on the sidewalk costs on Harrell Street.

It was the consensus of the Town Council to leave the ordinance on "Dangerous Animals" as is because of the safety factors.

Mr. Britton reported he has received a letter from Mr. Bill Caldwell, requesting the Town to furnish several items at the Ball Park, which includes bases, benches, canvas for backstop and use of the Concession Stand at the Park.

Mr. Carter made the motion, seconded by Mr. Lawson, to deny the request for bases at the Ball Park, and all members voted yes.

Mr. Lawson made the motion, seconded by Mr. Gordon to let the Youth Association have the use of the concession beginning the end of this month (April) and deny the other requests.
