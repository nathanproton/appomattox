Re: Extension of Waterlines from the Town to the Water Tank in Appomattox

Dear Bill:

Construction cost estimates to complete referenced work are presented herein. Two alternatives are open to the Town in this regard. The estimates for either alternative are based on limiting the scope of work to the minimum amount required to place the tank on line. This scope would include installation of waterlines, air release valves, cathodic protection of tank, borings where required by the Highway Department, tank testings, contingencies and engineering.

The first alternative would be to bid material and installation for an estimated cost of $235,000.00. The second alternative assumes that the Town would purchase the necessary pipe and fittings and bid the installation of the same. The cost of the latter is estimated to be $216,000.00.

These cost estimates indicate that the Town would need additional funding of between $65,000.00 and $85,000.00 if they should be awarded the $151,000.00 from HUD under the latest competitive offering.

Sincerely,

MAY-HINES & ASSOCIATES

Bernard C. Proctor, P.E.
