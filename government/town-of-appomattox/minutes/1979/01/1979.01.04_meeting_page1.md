content: A Public Hearing was held on Thursday, January 4, 1979 at 9:00 A.M. for the purpose of briefing the citizens of Appomattox on the 1979 Community Development Grant Request from HUD for additions to the Appomattox water and sewer systems. 

The Public Hearing was opened by Town Manager W. R. Britton, Jr. at 9:00 A. M. as required by law. 

Those present were: Mrs. R. W. Mullins, Mrs. V. A. Volturo and Harold Nash, Sr. 

Mr. Britton reported that we are applying for $600,000.00 of Single Purpose funds for Community Development. 

These funds would be used to construct and rehabilitate water lines and restore and rehabilitate some sewer lines. More pre-applications will be submitted to HUD than can be funded. The Town will first have to submit a pre-application and if accepted for funding, a full application will have to be submitted to HUD. 

There being no citizens present to be heard, Mr. Britton closed the hearing at 9:05 A.M.
