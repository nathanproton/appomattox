content: conferred. The subscribers retain control through an elected Advisory Committee of their representatives. This body sets the policies for the framework of the Subscribers' Agreement by which the reciprocal is to be operated.

Legal Position

The Insurance Committee felt that it would be desirable to have a written opinion from the Office of the Attorney General concerning the authority of localities to join together to form a reciprocal insurance company. Based on this letter (Appendix B, page 18) it would appear that such authority does exist.

Requirements for Organizing a Reciprocal

The requirements for organizing and licensing a Virginia reciprocal insurance company are well outlined in the previously mentioned guide prepared by the Bureau of Insurance. (See Appendix A, page 15) There are two items on this list that require comment.

First, Item No. 1 refers to the requirement to have a minimum of 25 persons domiciled in Virginia to organize a reciprocal. These persons must file a statement that they have in good faith applied for insurance and paid in full the premium required for a period of at least six months. Thus, it would be necessary for at least 25 localities to commit themselves to becoming insureds upon approval of the new company's license to do business, and to have advanced the required premiums.
