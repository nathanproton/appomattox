content: The formation of the capital fund will be one of the last major hurdles before the successful implementation of the reciprocal on July 1, 1980. However, there are several smaller hurdles which must be overcome first. There is no lack of expertise available to assist us, but in order to continue the project we need your financial assistance NOW! We are seeking a contribution from each locality interested in seeing this proposal implemented. A contribution now does not commit your locality to join later. Only an allocation in your budget to participate in the capitalization fund can do that. What is needed now is approximately $10,000 in start up money to handle all the necessary details in forming this multi-million dollar local government reciprocal insurance company. The suggested contribution rate is as follows: POPULATION Under 5,000 - $50 5,000 - 25,000 - $125 25,001 - 50,000 - $250 50,001 - 100,000 - $325 over 100,000 - $500
