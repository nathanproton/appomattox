I thus informally conclude that, based on this pre-
liminary investigation, there is no bar to the formation of
a corporation to provide joint self-insurance to several
Virginia municipalities. Furthermore, this entity appears

decisions as to the propriety of creating such a self-
insurance entity.

With best wishes, I remain

Sincerely yours,

Maston T. Jacks
Assistant Attorney General
