The following members were present: John S. Grinels, C. C. Poe, G. E. Smith, J. C. Caldwell, C. Lewis McDearmon and T. Hunter Dickerson.

A Motion was made by G. E. Smith, seconded by John S. Grinels, That the Town put back the parking meter at the back entrance of the theatre that was pulled up. Motion carried.

Motion was made by T. Hunter Dickerson, seconded by John Grinels, That the Street Committee be authorized to contact the merchants to put in unloading zones where wise. Motion carried.

The Council unanimously agreed to have published in the Times Virginian a statement explaining the reason for installation of the parking meters and invite suggestions from the citizens of our trading area as how the town could improve its position to make it more convenient to trade here. It was also agreed no ballot would be incorporated as the result would not be a true picture of the feeling of the people. A copy of this letter will be attached and made a part of the minutes.

The Meeting adjourned.
