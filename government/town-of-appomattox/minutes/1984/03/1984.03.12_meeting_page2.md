content: Mr. Noble made a motion, seconded by Mr. Carter to approve the salary for David Garrett, Jr., of $10,500.00 per year. The day he passes his test for the sewer license, he would be raised to $11,700.00. He (David) will get a maximum of one year to take his test. The town truck will stay at the shop at nights and as the job of "working foreman" progresses and Mr. Garrett does well at his job, the truck will be given for his use.
