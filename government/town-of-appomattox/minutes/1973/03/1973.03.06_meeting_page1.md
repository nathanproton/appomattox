Dear Mr. Slagle:

As I discussed with you in person the other day, we would like to request substituting the re-zoning hearing previously requested by us at the Town Council meeting. This involves the lots on Highway 460 at Annie Street, and the lot on Patricia Anne Lane just behind the school bus garage, to a lot that we now feel would be less objectionable to re-zoning. This lot is owned by Mr. E. LeRoy Smith on East Patricia Anne Lane, 125 ft. fronting East Patricia Anne Lane adjoining the property owned by Evans and Nash Construction Company, which is zoned Industrial, also all property in front of this lot is zoned Business or Industrial.

We hope this change can be accomplished without another appearance before Town Council.

I thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

Yours very truly,

Elmer B. Nealy
Store Services Manager
