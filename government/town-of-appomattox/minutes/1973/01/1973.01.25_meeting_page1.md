content: This public hearing was held by the Town of Appomattox which is required for the change in establishment amusement center, pool hall, and such within a zoned area of business. Advertised in the Times-Virginian on January 25, 1973 as such: "A public hearing will be held by the Appomattox Town Council on Tuesday, January 30, 1973, at 1:00 P.M. in the Appomattox Town Hall in order that interested citizens can express their views concerning the application from Ashby Wright and William R. Wilbun to operate an amusement center to be located in the same building formerly occupied by Wilbuns Store on Harrell Street in the Town of Appomattox. Further information can be obtained from the office of the Appomattox Town Manager."

The public hearing is duly called to order and we will be glad to hear the pros and cons of any individual person.

Mr. R. E. Wilbun
Appomattox, Va. 24522

Just like I said about telling the boys that if they operate it down there, I want them to operate, if they can do it, a nice up to date place of business and if it is not so well, it just won't be run. I don't have too much to say, no more than that towards, of course, I own the property. I like it to be an up to date run in requirement of what they would expect for it to be.

Mayor Pack: Alright, thank you. Mrs. Wilbun do you have any comment?

Mrs. Wilbun: Just the same that he says.

Mayor Pack: We have with us, Mr. Ranson.

Ranson: At this time I would like to speak on the behalf of Nettie Martin if I may. She's a property owner adjoining the property that we're speaking of and she asked me to speak for her today. That she is opposed to this cause she thinks it will be improper.
