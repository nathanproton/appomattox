Dear Mr. Jamerson:

This is to advise that the Appomattox Town Council at its meeting on December 21, 1973 rescinded its position taken on August 11, 1971 which permitted Triangle Plaza to "double" the amount permitted in paragraph 4 of the original letter dated July 22, 1971.

The Council also went on record as acknowledging the following as existing connections to the Town of Appomattox water and/or sewerage systems which are located in and around the Triangle Plaza Shopping Center:

1. A.B.C. Store; 2. Sears Catalog Sales; 3. Discount gasoline island; 4. Garretts Hallmark; 5. Ritter Loan;
6. Farmers National Bank; 7. Revco Drug Store;
8. Super Dollar Store; 9. King's Supermarket.

Furthermore, a resolution was offered and passed which requires that no future connections outside the corporate limits of the Town of Appomattox be made to the existing water or sewer systems without first obtaining permission for such connections from the Appomattox Town Council.

Thank you,

W. S. Slagle
Town Manager
