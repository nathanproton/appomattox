Dear Mr. Slagle:

We would like to request a postponement on action for a re-zoning hearing on the lots at 460 and Annie Street and Patricia Anne Lane. The purpose of the postponement will be to allow us more time to search for a different and maybe better location. However, if no other location can be obtained, we would like the hearing on a later date.

I appreciate Council's time, courtesy and consideration at last night's meeting.

Thank you with best regards.

Yours very truly,

Elmer E. Nealy
