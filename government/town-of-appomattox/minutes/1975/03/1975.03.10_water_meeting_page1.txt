A meeting of the Water Committee was held on March 10, 1975 at 7:00 P.M.

Those present were Mrs. C. H. Robinson, Mr. R. C. Hubbard, and R. C. Spiggle.

The purpose of the meeting was to arrive at a decision regarding water service charges to certain businesses within the lower level of the office and retail sales building located at Triangle Plaza Shopping Center. Those businesses involved being the Carpet Shop, Carole's Fashions, Nancy's Beauty Salon, Gallier Inc. and Depoe Insurance Agency.

The committee decided to recommend to the Appomattox Town Council that the above named businesses be considered two water customers for bill purposes. Specifically Nancy's Beauty Salon and the common toilet facilities are the two water customers.

It is further recommended that any business in Triangle Plaza which has facilities utilizing water within the space rented and each common facility will be considered as water customers.
