content: RESOLUTION FOR T. RANDOLPH GILBERT

Whereas, God in his infinite wisdom, on October 30, 1965, called to eternal rest our esteemed member and co-worker, T. Randolph Gilbert, and

Whereas, the passing of Mr. Gilbert brought to an untimely end a record of outstanding civic service, both as a member of the council and as a citizen of the community; and

Whereas this loss has made us acutely aware of his wise counsel and willingness to be of service to his fellow citizens including his value to his church and other community activities.

Therefore, Be It Resolved by this special committee with the concurrence of the Mayor and the entire council that a copy of this resolution of respect be adopted and spread upon the permanent minutes of this body, an attested copy be transmitted to his widow and further that a copy of same be published in the Times-Virginian.

H. B. Fox, Mayor
Mrs. Calvin Robinson, Chairman of Committee
