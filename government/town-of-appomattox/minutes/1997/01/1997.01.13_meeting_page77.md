Council Minutes
January 13, 1997

The Street Committee was requested to look into the problem at Barbara Caldwell’s
on Atwood Street with storm water and also Ms Ora McCoy has approached

Mayor Spiggle with an idea of an outlet for the Post Office from the backside on the
property. By Consensus Council agreed that the Post Office look into these situations
themselves.

Mayor Spiggle informed Council that they have received one bid for removal of the
thirty thousand gallon water tank but he has been informed by the Town Attorney
that due to the cost we need to get more than one bid.

There being no further business to come before Council, the meeting adjourned.

Of

Ronald C. Spigglé, Ma
