I am here tonight to speak in favor of the Town Council adopting the proposed ordinances to
allow chickens to be kept in residential areas in Town Limits.  The ordinance proposed is fair in
lot dimensions and setbacks from neighboring structures.  The minimum and maximum
dimensions for chicken coops and run falls are within the standard poultry keeping
recommendations.  Like a lot of people today with all the recalls and scares I have become more
aware of where my food comes from and what is in it.  I read labels in the grocery store.  If I
can’t pronounce an ingredient I probably don’t’ want to eat it.  Within the last month my family
has started drinking milk from pasteurized jersey cows with no genetically modified ingredients
instead of milk from the commercially raised grain free cows.  We also eat pasteurized beef
instead of grain feed beef.  If we can’t grow it ourselves, we buy produce from local farmers.  A

natural extension of this type of thinking and eating is raising chickens for egg production.  My
neighbor, former neighbor Dr. Powell insists there is nothing wrong with eating two (2) eggs for
breakfast.  He has been doing it for years.  Having raised chickens in California, I have personal
experience with the appearance and taste of a home grown egg as opposed to an egg from egg
producing factory environment.  Nothing can beat it.  Chickens kept as described in these
ordinances will not be a nuisance to neighboring hens are much quieter than barking dogs,
besides they sleep at night.  They are not as dangerous as other animals.  A hen peck is not as
serious as a dog bite or cat scratch.  Roosters are another story but they are not permitted
underneath these ordinances.  Chickens can also make fun family pets they are curious and have
many natural behaviors that can be amusing and soothing to watch.  They are something that
strikes the very basic core of all of us watching them scratch in the dirt or chasing down crickets
or plucking grass.  Just like dogs they come running to greet you, looking for treats.  In return
they give us eggs, the perfect food.  Eggs are loaded with vitamins, minerals and proteins.  They
improve our cholesterol profile – they produce choline an important nutrient for the brain.  They
contain the proteins necessary for amino acids that our body can’t produce.  Have antioxidants
which help protect the eyes and help reduce body fat.  However, in a factory, caged, grain fed
environment these proteins and nutrients are altered.  Pastured or homegrown eggs are the best.  I
urge you to adopt these ordinances to allow residents to keep backyard chickens.  Thank you.

Kudos to Linda Lipscomb.  Three years ago next month I began a journey with this Town
Council and trying to have an ordinance approved for the care and maintenance of chickens in
this town.  In that 3 year period of time, I have lost 34 lbs.  I have more wrinkles and my hair is
grayer and we still don’t have an ordinance.  Shame on you.  However, I am quoted in the
newspaper more than you are.  So that’s all I have to say.  I said it all 3 years ago.  Wish you
would make a decision.  This is not rocket science.  It takes a one syllable answer – yes or no.
Thank you.

Mayor Harvey closed the public hearing.
