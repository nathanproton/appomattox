1  Appomattox Town Council

Special Call Council Meeting
May 5, 2015

The Appomattox Town Council held a Special Call Council meeting on Tuesday, May 5, 2015
at 6:00 p.m. at the Appomattox Municipal Building, 210 Linden Street, Appomattox, Virginia
with Mayor Harvey presiding.

Members present:  Timothy W. Garrett, C. Lewis McDearmon, Jr., Mary Lou Spiggle and
Claudia G. Puckette.

Absent:  N. H. “Jimmy” Mayberry and Steven T. Conner

Others present:  Patricia Garrett, Administrative Assistant for Public Works; Jeff Elder, Facilities
Director; Stacey Wilkes, Town Treasurer; Bill Gillespie, Town Manager and Roxanne Casto,
Town Clerk.

Mayor Harvey called the Special Call meeting to order.

Mr. Gillespie provided information regarding the letter of conditions from the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the Trickling Filter Plant project.

Ms. Wilkes provided a funding analysis for the USDA project.  The funding breakdown consists
of $3,780,000.00 in a loan and $879,000.00 in form of a grant for a total of $5,659,000.

The Town will be required to have the following reserves:  Operation & Maintenance
$130,473.00; Depreciation of Short-lived assets $164,200.00; and Debt Service Reserve
$145,152.00.  USDA is waiving the $650,000.00 capital reserve amount.  The town already has
the Operation & Maintenance and Depreciation of Short-Live Assets.

This will be a 40 year loan with an interest rate of 2.125%.  The interest rate is now locked so it
will not be higher but if it is lower at the time of closing we would receive the lower rate.  The
first two years will be interest only for approximately $79,800.00.  The remaining payments will
be monthly payments of $12,096.00 or annual debt service of $145,152.00.

The anticipated project completion date is during 2018.  The debt service reserve would be
funded in 2018.  There would only be interest in FY 2019 and 2020.  In FY 2021, the Town
could have a need to subsidize from the general fund.  This projection anticipates the worst case
scenario and a 2.5% increase in expenses each year.  The 2.5% increase has not been
experienced for FY 2016.  The expenses are flat for FY 2016.

The current VRA (Virginia Resource Authority) bond the Town has will be paid off in
September 2021.

In conclusion, Mr. Gillespie and Ms. Wilkes concur it is time to take care of the aging Trickling
Filter Plant.  The project is financially possible for the Town.

Council thanked the staff for their hard work in making this possible.
