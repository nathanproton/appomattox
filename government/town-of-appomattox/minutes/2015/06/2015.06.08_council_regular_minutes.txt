PROCLAMATION

Whereas, Norman H. “Jimmy” Mayberry served as a member of the Appomattox Town Council since
1995; and

Whereas, Mr. Mayberry untiringly devoted over 19 years to our community during a period of time that
numerous projects were initiated through his leadership which will continue to have a revitalizing and
growing impact on our community far beyond his term of office; and

Whereas, Mr. Mayberry was always willing to place his concern for the public good ahead of his personal
interests and thus, has earned the admiration and high regard of other civic leaders and the affection of a
host of area residents; and

Whereas, Mr. Mayberry was unique in his sensitivity for doing what was best for the entire community,
and he had courage in expressing his convictions and a special way of dealing with complex issues; and

Whereas, if there was one characteristic that distinguished Mr. Mayberry’s career as a public servant, it
was his enormous capacity for hard work – no one in these parts ever put more of himself into the job of
working for his community than did Mr. Mayberry; and

Whereas, Mr. Mayberry demonstrated in many practical ways his deep and genuine love for our
community and the surrounding area;
