A meeting of the Street Committee was held at 6:00 P.M. on March 11, 1977 at the Town Office.

Members present were Mr. Guill, Mr. Spiggle, and Mr. Hubbard.

After a discussion of the possible donation of right-of-way on the east side of Lee Street from the Masonic Lodge, the Street Committee recommended to Town Council that an option be acquired and an explanation by Council to the Masonic Lodge that the Town cannot promise to widen the street within the next three years but that it is planned in the future and we would appreciate the opportunity of having an option.

The meeting adjourned.
