Mrs. Addie Ould was concerned with citizens who own their own wells. She wanted to know if they would be billed for sewer and how.

Mr. Waddell expressed the opinion that we need to charge the schools for all the sewerage they use. He was informed that the Schools now pay 25% of their water bill to sewerage.

Mr. Holland questioned whether we were trying to pay for the new proposed Sewage Treatment Plant with these new rates.
