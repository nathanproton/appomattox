Dear Bill:

We are writing to you and the Town Council to request a change in the zoning plan and the zoning map for the Town of Appomattox.

We hereby respectfully request that the parcels of land facing and fronting on the southwestern side of Court Street in the block bounded by Ferguson Street on the north and by Morton Lane on the south be changed from their present R-1 zoning to a new zoning of B-1. This change is requested to only affect the lots facing and fronting on Court Street and to include the depth of each of the individual lots.

Enclosed please find a portion of the zoning map showing the approximate location of the proposed change along with a petition in favor of said change signed by several property owners.

We will be happy to meet with you and/or Town Council to discuss the details of this request.

Very truly yours,

Dan H. Hencall
Thomas W. Lawson
