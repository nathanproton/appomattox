RESOLUTION

Authorization to Pick up the Employees Contribution to VRS

WHEREAS, the _Appomattox Town Council___ desires to provide its employees with tax deferral
pursuant to § 414 (h) Internal Revenue Code (IRC) with respect to their member contributions to the

for the permissible purchase of past service credit by picking up member contributions to the VRS; and

WHEREAS, the pick up is authorized under § 51.1-142.2 of the Code of Virginia, as amended from time
to time; and

WHEREAS, the VRS keeps track of such picked up member contributions, and is prepared to treat such
contributions as employee contributions for all purposes of VRS;

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED that effective the first pay day on or after the later of
___July 1, 2018____ or the date the member executes a binding and irrevocable salary reduction election
relating to the past service permitted to be purchased, the ___Town of Appomattox___ shall pick up all or
a portion of the member contributions of its employees to VRS based on the terms of the salary reduction
election, and such contributions shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment
under the IRC; and it is further

RESOLVED, the binding salary reduction election to be executed by the member shall include the
following: (1) the beginning and ending date of the election, (2) the amount of the salary reduction on a
pay period basis, (3) the total amount of contribution expected to be involved, (4) a statement that the
member may not receive the contributed amounts instead of having them paid by the ___Town of
