or the Town.

Mr. Boyce – Will there by lights at night?
Rev. Small – No, not currently.

Mr. Conner – Stated it will open the area up to everyone, works to hook it all together and it
looks like a great plan.

Mayor Harvey – Town Council will refer to the Physical Development Committee after hearing
positive responses.  The Physical Development Committee will bring back reports to the entire
Council.

Mrs. Puckette – One of the components of the Master Plan was to have a space for all ages, in
conjunction with the Town.  Her concern is to be able provide help with the park if dthe Town is
legally able.

Rev. Small advised that the church will be able to say with more certainty a reasonable timeline
and funding options within a month.  The church is hopeful that the Town may be able to aid in
maintenance since it already maintains the water and sewer line easement/right of way.

Town Council thanked Rev. Small for the presentation.
