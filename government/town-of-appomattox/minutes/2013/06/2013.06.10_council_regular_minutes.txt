Monday, June 10, 2013

On a motion by Mr. Mayberry, seconded by Ms. Spiggle, Council voted to amend and reeanact
the Code of the Town of Appomattox, Chapter 33, Procurement Policy by amending §33-3.  All
members present voting aye.  Motion carried.

AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND AND REENACT the Code of the Town of Appomattox,
Chapter 33, PROCUREMENT POLICY by amending §33-3.

Be it ordained by the Council of the Town of Appomattox, as follows:

Section 1.  Chapter 33, Section 3 shall be amended and reenacted as follows:

Chapter 33. PROCUREMENT POLICY

[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Council of the Town of Appomattox 3-23-1998; amended in its
entirety 12-8-2008. Subsequent amendments noted where applicable.]

§ 33-1. Intent.

A. The purpose of this document is to promulgate the policies of the Town of Appomattox
pertaining to procurement of goods and services. This policy will ensure conformance with the
public procurement provisions of the Code of Virginia. State law reference: Code of Virginia,
Title 2.2, Ch. 43.

B. The end that the Town obtain high quality goods and services at a reasonable cost, that all
procurement procedures be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with avoidance of any
impropriety, that all qualified vendors have access to Town business and that no offerer be
arbitrarily or capriciously excluded, it is the intent of the Appomattox Town Council that
competition be sought to the maximum practical degree, that the rules governing contract award
be made clear in advance of the competition, that specifications reflect the needs of the Town
rather than being drawn to favor a particular vendor, and that the Town and vendor freely
exchange information concerning what is to be procured and what is offered.

C. This policy is intended to supersede and override any earlier purchase or spending policy
adopted by the Appomattox Town Council.

§ 33-2. General.

A. The Town Manager is designated as the Purchasing Agent for the Town of Appomattox and as
such it shall be the Purchasing Agent's responsibility to ensure that the provisions of this policy
are followed.

B. The provisions of Chapter 43 of Title 2.2 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended,
otherwise known as the Virginia Public Procurement Act, are hereby incorporated by reference
and shall apply to purchases over $30,000 made by the Town of Appomattox as the context
indicates.

10  Regular Council Meeting

Monday, June 10, 2013

C. The value of a purchase is defined as the total obligation of the Town of Appomattox to a
vendor as represented by a single invoice or series of related invoices in a given calendar month,
except for utility services or contracts existing as of the date of passage of this policy, in return
for goods or services.

§ 33-3. Additional methods of procurement.

A. Generally. Due to the need for expediency in allowing for the efficient administration of the
Town's operations, it is recognized that procedures and methods employed in the procurement of
higher valued goods and services are not appropriate for the purchase of lower valued items.
Therefore, separate rules for the procurement of items expected to cost $30,000 or less are
hereby established as indicated by the preceding section of this policy (Reference: § 2.2-4303 of
the Code of Virginia). Where different categories of purchases are established, the least
restrictive may apply.

B. Emergency purchases. Emergency purchases are exempt from the requirements of this section
and require no prior Council approval. However, the Purchasing Agent shall attempt to report
an emergency purchase to the Mayor and a member of the Town Council before making the
purchase. If such report is not reasonably practical, the Purchasing Agent shall notify the Mayor
and a member of the Town Council no later than 24 hours after occurrence of the emergency. An
"emergency purchase" is defined as a purchase of goods or services required by a sudden
occurrence rendering a part of the water and sewer utility system inoperable or creating another
immediate safety hazard or immediate risk of significant damage to Town property that did not
previously exist.

C. Limitations on spending authority and supporting provisions.

(1) Less than $10,000. The Purchasing Agent is authorized to purchase needed items and
services with a price of less than $10,000 without prior approval after taking reasonable steps to
ensure competitive pricing given the nature of the item.

(2) Between $10,000 and $20,000. The Purchasing Agent, with the prior written approval of the
Mayor and one Council member or two Council members are authorized to purchase needed
items and services with a price between $10,000 and $20,000, after taking reasonable steps to
ensure competitive pricing given the nature of the item, which shall include obtaining a minimum
of two informal verbal bids. Any such purchase shall be reported to the Town Council at its next
regular meeting.

(3) Twenty thousand dollars or more. The Purchasing Agent shall obtain prior approval of the
Town Council before purchasing needed items and services with a price of $20,000 or more. The
Purchasing Agent shall also take reasonable steps to ensure competitive pricing given the nature
of the item, which shall include obtaining a minimum of two informal written bids.

(4) Exemptions. In the case of any purchase, Council may authorize an exception to the
procurement requirements of Subsection C where doing so is deemed appropriate, in the sole
discretion of Council.
