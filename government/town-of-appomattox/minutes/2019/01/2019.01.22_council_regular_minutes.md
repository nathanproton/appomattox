Staff Comments:
Mr. Shanaberger – The purpose behind this is an aging infrastructure.  It is at the end of its life
cycle.  If we don’t address these issues now, they are only going to get worse and more
expensive.  Now is the time to address these issues, unfortunately the only real way to address
this is through this type of action.  We’ve lost money the last 5 years when you combine our
water and sewer operations together – one-year water may turn you a little bit of profit, but we
lost money on the sewer system.  The last five (5) years through combined operations, we have
lost money.  That’s not a sustainable process.  Another important part of all of this in terms of
improving our infrastructure is to prove to USDA that we can afford to repay a loan.  It is
obviously our hope.  We’ve been very successful the last three (3) years to bring in nearly $5.4
million in grant money – if you divide that among the 1,800 town citizens, we have saved each
individual nearly $3,000.  A family of four (4) – that’s nearly $12,000 we’ve saved that family
through grant money.  Obviously, that’s what we want to do again.  But in the process or
possibility that we do not get grant money – we have to pay a loan or USDA loan.  USDA wants
to know that we can repay the loan.  That’s basically where we are at – we are in a situation
where we have infrastructure that needs attention – serious attention.  The water lines that need
to be repairs and replaced 2” reduced down to ½” due to build up and sediment – the water is

still safe – there is nothing wrong with the water, but it affects fire protection.  When the fire
department goes to the hydrant then there isn’t enough water pressure.  These are all important
issues and I think now is the time for the Town and the community take a good hard look at it
and this staff will do whatever the Town and community recommends.  I would like to see
something done where we can keep the Town moving forward and taking care of some of these
infrastructure problems.

Mayor Harvey – I know I am not staff, but I would like to point out we have not had a water
increase since July 2012 and the last sewer increase was July 2015.  So, it’s been four (4) years
on the sewer and seven (7) years on the water with no increase.  It is kind of hard when your
costs are going up every year to operate and you are keeping your income at a level point.

Mr. Shanaberger – I’d like to add – Bif Johnson with Hurt & Proffitt, Inc., is here tonight and he
and his staff did an exhaustive study for the Town - if there are some questions about the study
that was done.  I feel like just about everything was taken into consideration.  I did have several
people, handful called me and I’ve met several people downtown they brought the subject up to
me and I think once they understood – this is not something anybody wants but it is one of those
things that has to be done.  I think once people understood that we have failing sewer lines and
water lines that are no longer carrying the flow of water as they should, people understood it.

Mr. Shanaberger – received one handwritten note –
“Our water and sewage bill is already as costly as we can handle”.

It is important that you hear this comment.  I did not get a chance to talk with this person.  This
note was left in the drop box outside.

Mayor Harvey – Opened the floor for public comments.

Charles Clusman – owns and operates the Babcock House –
As an entity in Town that uses a lot of water and as a restaurant and a lodging/hospitality
provider – we definitely use a good bit of water.  This particular increase in our costs – what I’m
looking at when I’m doing my small little calculations – you’re increasing my average costs 18%
over the next 3 years.  I understand that there are issues that need to be taken care of and you add
them on to an already very slim margin that I am able to make, it’s a pretty good burden on
myself and I know there are probably other people who have the opinion on the matter as I do.  I
just want to know – questions – can you quantify the amount of money the Town has lost over
the last 5 years?

Mr. Shanaberger – I can – as a matter of fact – I’ll be happy to share this with you and anybody
else who would like a copy – I’ll share it with you.  The individual different departments – In
year 2017, for the water department we lost $110,000 and then if you come down, we made
$82,000 – but that’s still a net loss.

Mr. Clusman – Yea, I can read a P&L sheet here – It is all nicely color coordinated.  I know you
said you were talking to a gentleman here that did the study from the Town?  Do you have any
recommendations in what the Town should do in this matter?  What costs are for that?

Mr. Bif Johnson – Basically, the recommendations the Mayor read are our recommendations.

Mr. Clusman – Well that’s just increasing the price point so what is our…

Mayor Harvey interjected – under normal circumstances – you are not allowed to speak to
others.  You need to direct your comments to Council.  If you want to speak with Mr. Johnson…

Mr. Clusman – I’ll just direct my questions to you (Mayor).

Mayor – We cannot have a conversation back and forth.  We allow you to speak.  If you want to
come and meet with Mr. Shanaberger you can.  The comments/questions between you and the
audience is not appropriate.

Mr. Clusman – I understand that now.  I apologize.  I am trying to get some information because
the recommendations are not put out there for public viewing.  I’ll have to address them
appropriately.  I’m just trying to figure this out as it’s a big impact on my business as well as
other businesses.  I think that I would urge that the Town Council take that into consideration put
more information out there to the residents of the Town, so we have all the information available
to us.  Before you make a vote – all I can ask is that before you put 17% or more on one utility
cost on any business definitely one that’s running a pretty slim profit margin.  I understand there
are things that we need to take care of – I’m not saying we need to put it off – I’m just saying we
need to take a real hard look at all the options.  I hope you’ll be able to get those
recommendations out for public viewing.  Thank you very much.

Mayor Harvey closed the hearing as there was no one else to speak.
