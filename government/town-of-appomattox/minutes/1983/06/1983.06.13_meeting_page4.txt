Motion carried unanimously.

Council discussed the question of raising the penalty on Real Estate and Personal Property taxes. They requested Mr. Britton to check into this further and bring it back to Council at the next meeting.

Mr. Britton reported that the County Board of Supervisors has tenatively agreed to pay 50% of the roof work and 75% of the paving on the Fire Department driveway. They have requested that the Town consider giving the County one-half of the rental amount paid by the D.M.V. on the Council chambers. Council's consensus was that this be considered at the budget time.

There being no further business to come before Council, the meeting adjourned at 8:55 P.M.
