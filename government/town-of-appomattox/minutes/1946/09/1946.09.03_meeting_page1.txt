Dear Sir,

It is such a rare man as you have served as councilman since Aug. 1935 and declined to be a candidate at the June election of this year. And your term expired on September 1st, 1946.

We the officials of the Town who have served with you take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the services rendered by you to this community, and this certificate having been adopted by each of us as a Christian gentleman and businessman.

We regret that conditions over which you have no control make your retirement necessary. We will all miss you, but rest assured that our best wishes go with you and our earnest prayers that you may be speedily restored to vigorous health.

Sincerely your friends,

The entire official body of which you were a member so long.

Clerk.
