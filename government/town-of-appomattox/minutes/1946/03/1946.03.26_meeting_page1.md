content: Dear Sir:

The State Highway Commission at its meeting on March 26, 1946, passed a Resolution agreeing to take over the sections within the incorporated towns, having a population of 3500 and less according to the last preceding census, that are less than 30 feet in width for maintenance where the Form "A" agreements have been executed, and pay for the maintenance where the Form "B" agreements have been executed.

The State Highway Commission is, therefore, waiving the provisions contained in the agreements and ordinances whereby the sections less than 30 feet in width would not be maintained by the Department of Highways.

In order that the records will be complete and this letter will become a part of the agreement, you will please approve and sign three copies of this letter, in the space designated, attaching one signed copy to the agreement in your files and returning two signed copies to the Department of Highways, 1221 East Broad Street, Richmond 19, Virginia, to be attached to the agreements on file in this office and our District Office.

Yours very truly,
J. A. Anderson
State Highway Commissioner of Virginia

BY ACTION OF THE TOWN COUNCIL

1946.
ATTESS: W. Gawhan Clerk (or Recorder).
BY: Thos. J. Williams Mayor.
