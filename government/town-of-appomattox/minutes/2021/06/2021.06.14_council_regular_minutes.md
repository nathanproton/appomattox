Mayor’s Comments:
It looks like we are finally coming out of the other side of COVID, and this is a great thing.

Scheduled Public Appearances:
Joetricia Humbles, Appomattox for Equality appeared before Council – Thank you for allowing
Appomattox for Equality an opportunity to speak to you regarding the importance (of)
Juneteenth not only to African Americans in our community, but it(s) historical significance for
Appomattox.  Juneteenth has been around for over 150 years but for many people who are
hearing about it for the first time it seems brand new.  If July 4th, Independence Day, is about the
beginning of our freedom, Juneteenth is about fulfilling the promise in the Declaration of
Independence that all people are created equal and that all people have rights.

As I heard in a speech given by Dr. Tomika Ferguson, she stated that Roscoe Simmons, who is
the nephew of Booker T. Washington, was a columnist for the historical Black newspaper
Chicago Tribune wrote in 1924 that slavery began and ended in Virginia, and viewed
Appomattox as a place of salvation for African-Americans.  This salvation was created by the
surrender at Appomattox County (Court) House on April 9th 1865 which is also known as
Freedom Day for African Americans, which provided them with emancipation, freedom, and
pride.  However, not all enslaved people were aware of their freedom like the enslaved people of
Appomattox.  The enslaved people of Texas did not receive this announcement until June 19th,
1865.  So, on Juneteenth we are not just remembering the announcement of Emancipation in
Galveston Texas, but the end of slavery as an institution in the United States.  On June 19th,
freedom for all was finally acknowledged, even if it though it has not been fully fulfilled.  The
first celebration of Freedom Day in 1866 was organized by the formerly enslaved people of
Galveston, which has led to the idea it was only about them.  It is a day that all of us are part of

because it is the day the struggle for freedom was joined by the struggle for equality.  While
Juneteenth may be a new holiday for some, it is a day for all people.  It reminds us of the hard
history of where we have been, it reminds us of what we still need to learn, and it challenges us
to live up to the promise of what we can and should be.  Learning about the history of
enslavement and the long struggle for true freedom and equality that followed emancipation is
not easy.  It is a complicated and discomforting story.  But in the words of Frederick Douglas
history has shown us that “Without struggle, there is not progress” and it has also shown us that
without discomfort there is no change.

I would like to invite you to join us at our 2nd Juneteenth Celebration to gain more insight in the
importance of Juneteenth.  If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding Appomattox for
Equality, please feel free to reach out to us via Facebook, our website, or any of our board
members which are myself, Joetricia Humbles, Laquil Humbles, Shronda Mosley, Tyresha
McCoy, Emily Wheeler, Dustin Williams, and Ken Arpino.  Once again, we would like to thank
you for this opportunity to speak.

Bif Johnson, Hurt & Proffitt, Inc. updated Council on the water and sewer review for 2021.  The
review covers a 3% annual rate increase for water and sewer through fiscal year 2023, already
approved by Town Council.  A new waterline loan for $500,000 added in late FY 2022.  The
sewer VRA loan will end FY 2022.  A new sewer USDA loan will start in FY 2022.  The review
also looked into the effects on revenue if the out-of-town users were increased by 1.5 times the
current rates.  Also, what effect would revenue have if there were an increase to water and sewer
usage.

Council thanked Hurt & Proffitt, Inc. for the updated information.  Hurt & Proffitt, Inc. thanked
Town Staff for their assistance.
