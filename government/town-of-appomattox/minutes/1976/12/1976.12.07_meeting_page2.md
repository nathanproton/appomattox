content: Mr. Quill informed Council that he had spoken with several persons in regard to the sidewalk on Evergreen Ave. Some of the property owners wish to see a completed design and plan before they grant right-of-way.

Quill also informed Council that Thomasville Industries plans to open for approximately thirty minutes a day, the street which turns off Ferguson and terminates into the Thomasville parking area, so that the afternoon traffic may exit onto other Routes than 460. Council granted permission for this to be done.

Spiggle presented a letter from Mr. and Mrs. Schneider who wish to know how the community would feel about a Folk Music Auditorium and Museum, probably to be located at the National Park on Route 24. Spiggle asked that council be aware of feelings of the public on this.

Council asked that Mr. Nash have the Christmas Lights up and ready to turn on December 1, 1976 and January 1, 1977 be the last date that lights will be on.

Spiggle presented a request by Jaycees to use part of the Depot warehouse area to sponsor a 'Santa' on certain days in December for the local children to visit. House suggested that Council offer their full support of this project, and this was unanimously agreed upon. Mayor stated that Mr. Nash would place a portable heater in the area for this time period.

Mayor Pack then called Council into executive session.
