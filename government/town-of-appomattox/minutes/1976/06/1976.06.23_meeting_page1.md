Dear Bill:

Recently we increased the General Liability coverage under your package policy to a $1,000,000 single limit. In addition, we wrote a policy to protect the Council and Town against Wrongful Acts and this carries a limit of $2,000,000.

The above policy covers the operation of automobiles owned by the Town and it carries Bodily Injury limits of $100,000 each person and $300,000 each occurrence and $25,000 property damage. The premium for this is $1202.00 per year.

It appears to me that we are being inconsistent if we do not increase this coverage to $1,000,000 and the additional cost would be $459.00 for a full year; however, we would pro rate that from now until January 1.

I would appreciate hearing from you on this matter and if there are any questions, let me know.

Most sincerely,

J. A. Burke & Co., INC.
