In checking with the Commission's Attorney, it has been determined that the law is still not completely clear as to whether annual plans are required. However, the Attorney felt Planning District Commissions, because of the word "each," have a legal right to prepare the Plan in accordance with the Virginia Code.

Other Actions Presently Being Undertaken

The Richmond Regional Planning District Commission's Executive Committee has gone on record supporting the concept that "the responsibility for criminal justice planning remain, in its entirety, with the Richmond Regional Planning District Commission". The Committee also resolved that "the Division of Justice and Crime Prevention be requested to provide additional planning funds". 

The Planning District Criminal Justice Advisory Committee, at its meeting on June 30, 1976, has recommended to the Virginia Association of Planning District Commissions, at its meeting scheduled for July 16, 1976, to take the following action:

a) Adopt a resolution requesting the Council on Criminal Justice to follow the previous policy agreements concerning review and comments on policy changes affecting criminal justice planning activities. This review and comment would allow sixty (60) days for local and planning district commissions to comment on any final proposal for reorganizing criminal justice planning activities within the Commonwealth of Virginia.

b) Adopt a resolution requesting the Council on Criminal Justice to involve regional, local, and state criminal justice planning commissions in efforts to determine the effectiveness of such planning activities to assure the coordination of the criminal justice planning activities within the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Recommendations to the Central Virginia Planning District Commission

The Criminal Justice Advisory Committee of the Central Virginia Planning District Commission recommends the following actions by the Central Virginia Planning District Commission concerning this problem of proposed reorganization of the criminal justice planning activities within the Commonwealth of Virginia:

1) It is recommended that the criminal justice planning activities be kept within the present structure and boundaries of individual Planning District Commissions, particularly the Central Virginia Planning District, and that planning funds be continued to be allocated to the individual Planning District Commissions for criminal justice planning activities. This does not preclude consolidating Planning Districts for more effective criminal justice planning, provided such consolidation is initiated by the affected planning district commissions.

2) It is recommended that the Central Virginia Planning District Commission request the Division of Justice and Crime Prevention to appear before the Board of Planning District Commissions and the Criminal Justice Advisory Committee of the Commission to explain the proposed reorganization, including facts to justify such reorganization, and to allow DJCP to obtain reaction of local governments to such reorganization.
