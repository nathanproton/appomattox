content: A meeting of the Street Committee was held on Wednesday, June 9, 1976 at 5:00 O'clock P.M.

Those present were B.H. Guill, R.C. Spiggle, W.S. Slagle, and Mayor Pack.

The purpose of the meeting was to review the Street Allotment for FY 76 and to determine what streets needed to be turned over to the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation.

W. S. Slagle advised that some streets (excluding through streets) that were public as of January 1, 1968 could be accepted by the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation with only 30 feet of right of way.

After some discussion it was the consensus of the Street Committee that the Town should attempt to turn over the following streets to the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation and in the order listed:

1. Commerce Street
2. Atwood Street
3. Harrell Street
4. Ethel Street

It was also the consensus of the Committee to recommend that the request for a loading zone by C.S. McDearmon be granted.

After reviewing the Route 1009 street situation it was the consensus of the Committee that the Town should wait until the proposed highway survey be done and the plans drawn before taking any action for permanent improvement of 1009.
