It was the consensus of Council that Bid Advertisement be dated October 12, 1976 and that advertisement be in the local paper only.

It was also the consensus that the old Town Hall be demolished and that the storm drainage aspect of the project be pulled out of the bid and performed by Town and State forces.

Mr. Wallcraft and Mr. Dales were present to explain Continental Telephone's position regarding disposal of the property necessary for the project.

Continental anticipates an addition next year and has roughly one half million investment in the existing location and to relocate would cost approximately one million.

Mr. Dales proposed that is the Town would act as intermediary, that Continental would buy property from the Bank or the McDearmon Estate to replace that required by the street.

The requirement would be roughly 30-40 feet by 70 feet additional on the East side of their building and 20-30 additional on the West side.

The Town agreed to act as intermediary and pursue this matter.

Meeting adjourned.
