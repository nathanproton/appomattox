content: Council had no comment on the A-95 review of the Nutrition Program for the Elderly.

A question arose as to the intent and purpose of the Town attorney retainer fee and whether the Town was in fact obligated to use the exclusive services of the Town attorney.

It was the consensus of Council that the retainer fee was primarily an availability fee and that the Town was not obligated to use his exclusive services.

The meeting adjourned.
