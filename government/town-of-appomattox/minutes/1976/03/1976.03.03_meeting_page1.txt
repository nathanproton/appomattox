Dear Committee Member:

At our Street Committee meeting on March 2, 1976 we forgot to bring the Engineer's proposal before the committee for the design work associated with the downtown redevelopment project.

Basically, he proposes to accomplish all the design work for a figure not to exceed $5,000.00, which is an eligible cost under the grant.

It is my recommendation that the Committee approve this phase of the project in order that we can accomplish the project as soon as possible.

Please indicate your choice below and return to the Town Office.

  I recommend acceptance of the proposal.

  I recommend rejection of the proposal.

Thank you,

H. B. Pack
