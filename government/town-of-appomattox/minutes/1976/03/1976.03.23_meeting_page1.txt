Those in attendance were R. C. Spiggle, R. C. Hubbard, W. S. Slagle, and Dr. Jim May and Ralph Hines representing the firm of May-Hines and Associates.

The purpose of the meeting was: 1. To discuss the feasibility of having aerial photographs prepared for the whole town as an extension of the photography required by the downtown redevelopment plan, 2. Discuss Step I of the regional sewerage program, 3. Discuss need for a flow meter at STP#1.

Dr. May advised the committee that such photography would cost $500.00 but if done later in a separate project would cost approximately $750.00 excluding the inflationary factor. He further advised that such photographs could be used to prepare 1 foot contour interval maps to be used for all public works projects and similar type construction type activities. In addition one positive would be provided.

A motion was made by Spiggle seconded by Hubbard to have the additional aerial photographs prepared at a cost of $500.00. Motion carried.

Dr. May then explained the procedure for Step I and the various components.

After some discussion a motion was made by Spiggle seconded by Hubbard to recommend to the Appomattox Town Council that a totalizing flow meter be purchased for STP number one and for the specific purpose of NPDES requirements in addition to Step I requirements. Motion carried.
