content: A special meeting of the Appomattox Town Council was held on Monday September 27, 1976 at 7:30 P.M. with Mayor Pack presiding.

Those present were R. C. Hubbard, M. J. House, R. C. Spiggle, R. L. Bass, B. H. Guill, and T. E. Conner.

The purpose of the meeting was twofold: 1. To review the Downtown project design and to take appropriate action with regard to bid advertisement 2. To meet with officials of Continental Telephone Company to discuss the acquisition of certain property from them which is necessary for the project.

Ralph Hines and William Berkley of May-Hines and Associates were present to present the design for the downtown project and to discuss the different alternates and related cost estimates.

Slagle advised the following:
1. All parcels had been acquired except those identified as Farmers Bank, McDearmon Estate and Continental Telephone.
2. The McDearmon Estate has agreed to sell for $12,000.00 as compared to the appraised amount of $5,227.00 That if the Town paid more than the appraised amount the difference would have to come from local funds unless a court awarded additional money. Also this transfer was contingent upon the Town's acquiring the Telephone and Bank property.
3. Settlement on the Bank property was contingent upon resolution of the Telephone property question.
4. The Town forces can install the storm sewer thereby removing it as a bid item.
5. That alternate bids can be accepted anticipating various options pending resolution of the right-of-way question.

After much discussion motion was made by Bass seconded by House to advertise for alternate bids anticipating the various options which may be dictated by property acquisition considerations.
