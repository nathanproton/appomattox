content: The regular meeting of the Appomattox Town Council met in the Mayor's Office on August 19, 1957 at 7:30 P.M., with Mayor Richard D. Robinson presiding. The following members were present: J. T. Irby, J. G. Caldwell, G. E. Smith, Mrs. C. E. Robinson and T. Hunter Dickerson. Mr. J. H. Phillips, District Engineer and C. H. Palmer, from the Department of Highways, appeared before the Council on behalf of the sewers on Route 460, to explain to the town the curb and gutter project 1906-08. The project was discussed in detail by the Engineers and the Town Council, and it was decided that the Town of Appomattox does not have funds available at this time to participate in the Storm Sewer project as the Town's share is estimated to be $575.00. However, the Town Council is interested in the proposal and some time will be needed to study this matter. The Council will act in the best interest of the citizens. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved as read. A motion was made by Mrs. C. E. Robinson, seconded by G. E. Smith, that the Town Manager get someone to put a top and chimney to the incinerator back of the Drug Store. Motion carried. There being no further business the meeting adjourned to meet again on the regular meeting date of September 16, 1957. Signed Richard D. Robinson, Mayor. Signed C. C. Hunter, Clerk.
