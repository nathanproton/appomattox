Public Comments –
Doug Webb – 1935 Country Club Road, Appomattox, Virginia
Mr. Webb appeared before council to address the letter he received regarding the Sign
Ordinance.  The portable sign located on his property has been there for nearly 30 years.  It has
been an effective marketing tool.  He stated that he had a customer in today that remembers the
sign from 1984 that stated “If it’s round, rubber and rolls – we sell it.”  With Wal-Mart coming
into town he hopes the town council would not throw up road blocks to small businesses.  Mr.
Webb stated he fully concurs with prohibiting portable signs in residential and historic districts
but not on Business 460.  The business corridor is not a pristine place, it’s not like Williamsburg.
The Business License Tax doubled for businesses this year.  Mr. Webb asked that Town Council
reconsider certain portions of the ordinance.  It has been an effective communication tool.

Presentations –
Clifford Harvey – 168 First Street, Appomattox, Virginia
Mr. Harvey presented a petition stating the following:

We, the undersigned business owners of the Town of Appomattox, Virginia, do hereby
respectfully request that the Appomattox Town Council immediately enter into a water purchase
agreement with the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors to purchase water from the U.S.
460 (Concord to Appomattox) waterline.

We, the undersigned water customers and/or citizens of the Town of Appomattox, Virginia,
respectfully make this request because:

(1) We believe the U.S. 460 (Concord to Appomattox) waterline will provide Appomattox

with an adequate, reliable water source for its citizens and business;

(2) We believe that purchasing water from the U.S. 460 (Concord to Appomattox)

waterline will resolute in a lower water rate than is presently charged by the Town of
Appomattox, which will, in turn, lower the water bill that we currently pay;

(3)  We believe that purchasing water from the U.S. 460 (Concord to Appomattox)

waterline will be a solution to the zinc and copper issues, as presented by the Virginia
Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), at the Town’s wastewater treatment plants, and
will result in a cost savings by not having to purchase chemicals to combat the zinc and copper
issues; and

(4) We believe that the U.S. 460 (Concord to Appomattox) waterline will increase

economic development activities in Appomattox, which will result in lower taxes for us all.

Mr. Harvey stated that there are 477 signatures on the two petitions, 328 town residents, 62 town
business owners and 87 out of town water customers.  The petition represents approximately
50% of the town’s water customers.

Of the citizens visited with the petition more than 90% supported the waterline, so they signed
the petition.  Some were not necessarily opposed to the waterline they just don’t sign there
names to such things as petitions.

Mr. Harvey read the purpose of the petition:

It is my hope that the Town Council will respect the wishes of the individuals who signed this
petition by working with the County of Appomattox.  I humbly ask that you don’t disregard this
petition.  Thank you.
