content: To The Honorable Mayor and Town Council of Appomattox, Va.

Your committee, appointed to investigate activities of the night Police and to make report to the December meeting of Council, beg to report as follows -

The Committee met on the 19th of November, with all members present and also the night Police - after a full and thorough questioning on every angle of the charges and complaints brought to the attention of Council at the November 5th meeting and the night Policemen's answers to same, and with the light thrown on the matter, we find no cause to criticize the night Police. However, in view of the fact that the night Police has never been fully instructed or directed by the Council as to the use of his time while in the employ of the Town, that is, the hours he is on duty for the Town, we recommend that the full Council, with the night Police present, draft such instructions at the December meeting.

Respectfully submitted -
