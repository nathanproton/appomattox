Oath of Office to the Mayor and Council Members for the next ensuring term of office – July 1,
2016 – June 30, 2018.

Citizen Comment Period:
Don & Nancy Wilk – 1900 Church Street, Appomattox, Virginia
Mr. and Mrs. Wilk appeared before Council to express their intent to purchase the former
Appomattox Team Room on Church Street and their desire to have a specialty artisan market in
the lower level and are requesting to live upstairs.  The market will include real food from local
growers and hopefully organic will become the new normal.  They have a concept of farm to
table restaurant and upstairs residency.  There are 10 parking spaces available in the rear of the
property.  They expect to close on the property at the end of the month.

Shirley Walker – P O Box 2106, Appomattox, Virginia and works at Hometown Pharmacy
appeared before Council because of a disturbing incident in the parking lot at the Triangle Plaza.
Five (5) men had her car surrounded and would not let her leave.  She called the Sheriff’s Office
and the deputy talked to her like she had done something wrong.  She didn’t appreciate what
happened.  She said Sheriff Letterman treated her like a joke.  She said she wasn’t sure what the
protocol was for this but something needs to be done.  There is broken glass and kids trashing the
parking lot at the Triangle Plaza.  She said the owner of the property has called the Sheriff and
the Sheriff isn’t very receptive.  Nothing seems to be getting done.  She wanted to know how the
Council could help to solve this problem before it gets any worse.

Mayor’s Comments:
Mayor Harvey invited the community to a “Town Community Visioning” meeting on Tuesday,
June 1st from 5:30 – 7:30 p.m. at the Appomattox Visitor’s Information Center, 210 Main Street,
Appomattox, Virginia.  This meeting will give property owners, etc. an opportunity to share
ideas of the business district area, a timeline of activities, etc.  It is vital to get input from those
groups of people.  As the project organizers, we need your input.
